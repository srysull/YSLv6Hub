## Build System

The build system has been configured and is working correctly. The following commands can be used:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Testing
npm run test
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage

# Building
npm run build
npm run watch

# Deployment
npm run deploy
npm run open
npm run logs
```

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Core Modules**
   - Implement `02_DataAccess.ts` for sheet access and data management
   - Implement `03_Templates.ts` for UI templates

2. **Critical Functionality**
   - Implement `04_GroupsTracker.ts` for the GroupsTracker sheet functionality
   - Implement `05_SkillsSync.ts` for bidirectional synchronization

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Add more test cases for existing modules
   - Create tests for new modules as they're implemented

4. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed documentation for each module
   - Create user guides and developer documentation

## Conclusion

The development environment is now fully set up and ready for continued development. The initial modules are working correctly, and the build, testing, and deployment pipelines are functioning as expected.
